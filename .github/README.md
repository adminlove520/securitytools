This repo is a collection of open-source tools and resources for those in the realm of computer security.

The [`projects/`](../projects) directory is organized as a set of folders, each containing submodules that link to individual tools and resources. These folders are used as tags within the web explorer.

The [securitytools](https://adminlove520.github.io/securitytools) site provides a centralized view of all of the projects and tools within.

If you have an idea for a new addition, please open an issue
